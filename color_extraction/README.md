# Color Extraction Using Cosine Similarity
This project is about the color extraction by cosine similarity using the NumPy and Matplotlib. The HTML and Jupyter Notebook files show the full project that explains my implementation and its limitations. The Python files only contains the code for easy view. The difference between the two Python files is which color system I used to extract colors. One uses the RGB scale and the other uses HSV scale. The advantage of using HSV color system is that it extracts white color more accurately.

### NOTE:
GitHub says that the HTML and Jupyter Notebook files are too big to be displayed. I added the PDF version, but just in case this also doesn't show up, I will add the link to the Google Drive with all the files included. Here is the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YRnlTFdAxAVJH4yB83VXR54G5hCbLQ3V?usp=sharing

Please email me to this address (jkim1471@gmail.com) if you can't view the files or have questions about this project.
